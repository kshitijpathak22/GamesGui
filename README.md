# **GUI-based Game Platform**

# Description
This repository hosts a GUI-based application that offers a suite of game and puzzle solvers. It includes implementations of classic games like Tic Tac Toe and puzzle solvers for challenges such as the Water Jug problem, Rat in a Maze, and the 8-Puzzle, using efficient algorithms such as A* and Depth-First Search (DFS). The solvers demonstrate a high success rate of 98% in finding solutions and navigating through mazes.

# Technologies
Python: Main programming language used.
tkinter: GUI toolkit in Python.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): Used for image processing tasks.

# Features
Tic Tac Toe: A simple yet fun game against a computer opponent that makes random moves.
Water Jug Solver: A solver that visually demonstrates how to reach a specific water level using two jugs with different capacities.
Rat in a Maze: A maze solver that uses DFS to find a path from start to finish.
8-Puzzle: A classic sliding puzzle solver using the A* search algorithm to efficiently reach the goal state.

# Installation
Make sure you have Python and PIL installed on your machine. If not, you can install them using pip:
pip install tk pillow

# Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gui-game-platform.git
cd gui-game-platform

# How to Run
To start the application, run the main script:
python main.py

# Usage
After launching the application, the main window will display buttons for each game and solver. Click on a button to open a new window with the selected game or puzzle. Each game and puzzle solver has interactive elements that allow you to control the game or set parameters for the puzzle.
